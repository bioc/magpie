The goal of magpie is to perform statistical power analysis for differential RNA methylation calling, using MeRIP-Seq data. It takes real MeRIP-Seq data as input for parameter estimation, allows for options of setting various sample sizes, sequencing depths, and testing methods, and calculates FDR, FDC, power, and precision as evaluation metrics. It also offers functions to save results into .xlsx files and produce basic line plots.

## Installation

You can install the development version of magpie from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
