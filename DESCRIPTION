Description: This package aims to perform power analysis for the MeRIP-seq study. It calculates FDR, FDC,
 power, and precision under various study design parameters, including but not limited to 
 sample size, sequencing depth, and testing method. It can also output results into .xlsx files or 
 produce corresponding figures of choice.
